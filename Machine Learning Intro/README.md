# Intro to Machine Learning

1 .How Models Work:
The first step if you're new to machine learning.

2. Basic Data Exploration:
Load and understand your data.

3. Your First Machine Learning Model:
Building your first model. Hurray!

4. Model Validation:
Measure the performance of your model, so you can test and compare alternatives.

5. Underfitting and Overfitting:
Fine-tune your model for better performance.

6. Random Forests:
Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

7. Machine Learning Competitions:
Enter the world of machine learning competitions to keep improving and see your progress.
